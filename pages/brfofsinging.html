            Carnatic vocal music is a classical Indian music tradition that involves singing compositions with precise rhythm, melody, and emotional expression. It emphasizes creativity and improvisation while adhering to the rules of ragas and talas. The term "Carnatic" is derived from the Sanskrit word "Karnataka," which historically encompassed present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Karnataka. Carnatic music developed in this region, and its name reflects its strong association with the cultural and musical heritage of South India.
